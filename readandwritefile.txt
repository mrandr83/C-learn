This requires a file by the name of "my_first_file.txt" to exist in the same directory as the code.Here is a sample file:

9
56  3  8  -11  0  -45  55  2  78

Then change the code slightly to read from "my_second_file.txt" which contains doubles rather than integers. Sample:

6
13.5 22.7 8.0 -4.3 2.99 6.66
